Lammel Lab @UC Berkeley

As a research intern at Lammel Lab under the direction of Dr.Neta Gazit, I got involved in data analysis through writing matlab and python codes.

The matlab code is private for research purposes, and I have only a few that sets a new arena for the mouse video recordings, 
as well as that identifies crossing events.

Overall I try to create an excel document and a chart that helps to identify when the mouse crosses the food/empty zone.
Then it would be easier for Dr.Gazit to know where to look at from a long video recording, 
as those crossing events are considered critical.
